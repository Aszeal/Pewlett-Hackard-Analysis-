Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
The short answer is no. There is roughly 2,000 mentor-ready employees to train the next generation. On one condition, assuming that everyone retired at the same time. My opinion is that if Pewlett Hackard ensure that their is a steady amount of mentors it could lessen the blow of the "silver tsunami"
